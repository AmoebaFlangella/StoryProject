	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		Land of Dead Gods is a text-based, choose-your-own-adventure style
		web-browser based game. <br> While the story takes some
		inspirations from various media, the core of it is a completely
		original story. <br> This game is mainly a school project,
		however, I hope to work on it on-and-off and, hopefully, turn it into
		a full game at some point.
